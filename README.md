# Card-Match

# Intoduction
As part of my General Assembly bootcamp ou first project was to create a game using Javascript. Although, it was an enjoyable experience I didn't feel as though I learnt as much pure Javascript as I would've liked. So whilst I'm at home due to current circumstances I wanted to challenge myself and create a easyish game that I could learn from and I made a memory card game.

# Instruction
The game is simple that aim ofthe game is to match each card with its matching pair

# Issues I faced
the biggest issue I faced was that I was only meant to be able to pick two cards at a time but a buglead me being to pick multiple cards at the same time
